An approximation to the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent to the estimated changepoint is derived and shown to be numerically equal to a Bayesian posterior distribution for the changepoint. A hydrological example is given to show that inferences based on the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator can differ sharply from inferences based on the marginal distribution}",

    abstract = "{The paper develops a spatial generalized linear mixed model to describe the variation in the prevalence of malaria among a sample of village resident children in the Gambia. The response from each child is a binary indicator of the presence of malarial parasites in a blood sample. The model includes terms for the effects of child level covariates (age and bed net use), village level covariates (inclusion or exclusion from the primary health care system and greenness of surrounding vegetation as derived from satellite information) and separate components for residual spatial and non-spatial extrabinomial variation. The results confirm and quantify the progressive increase in prevalence with age, and the protective effects of bed nets. They also show that the extrabinomial variation is spatially structured, suggesting an environmental effect rather than variation in familial susceptibility. Neither inclusion in the primary health care system nor the greenness of the surrounding vegetation appeared to affect the prevalence of malaria. The method of inference was Bayesian using vague priors and a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation.}",

abstract = {The spatial and temporal variations of PM10 concentrations in the Netherlands as measured by the National Air Quality Monitoring Network in the period of 1993–1994 have been analysed using descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and Kalman filtering. Spatial differences in PM10 concentrations in the Netherlands are rather small. PM10 concentrations may be elevated by about 10–20% with respect to the yearly average, which is about 40μg/m3, in areas with local sources such as traffic or other urban, industrial or agricultural sources. Actual PM10 concentrations vary between 20 and 50μg/m3 throughout the year. During episodes, PM10 concentrations may increase to 4 to 5 times the annual average (>200μg/m3). The large amount of variance explained by the first component of PCA, i.e. 85%, shows that all measuring stations observe the same pattern of daily variations which is mainly governed by large-scale weather systems.The daily variations are analysed using multiple-linear regression and Kalman filtering; the latter employed as a time-varying linear regression technique. The results of the both methods are compared and show that using wind direction, temperature and duration of precipitation as variables, ordinary linear regression explains about 25% of the variance of PM10 concentrations, while the application of the Kalman filter explains about 45% of the variance. The improvement using the Kalman filter is primarily obtained by making the explaining variables time dependent. This shows a significant effect of seasonal variation on temperature and wind direction at PM10 levels.}
